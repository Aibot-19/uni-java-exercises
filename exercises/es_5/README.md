# Exercise 5 — (es5) Small exercise skeleton

Overview
--------
This folder contains a single `es5.java` source file that implements the exercise logic for exercise 5. The exact problem statement isn't included here, so this README provides general guidance for compiling, running and exploring the code.

Files
-----
- `es5.java` — main exercise implementation (likely includes a `main` function). Review the file to understand the problem and the entry point.

How to compile and run
----------------------
1. Compile:

   javac es5.java

2. Run (replace `es5` with the actual public class name if different):

   java es5

Exploration suggestions
-----------------------
- Open `es5.java` and read the comments or method names to infer the exercise requirements.
- Add simple print statements or temporary test code to exercise different code paths and verify behaviour.

BlueJ notes
