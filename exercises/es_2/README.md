# Exercise 2 — Integer lists and Round Table

Overview
--------
This exercise includes a simple integer singly-linked list and a small example that models seating around a round table. It is useful for practicing list manipulation and modeling circular relationships.

Files
-----
- `IntSList.java` — integer singly-linked list implementation. Typical operations: add, remove, iterate, size.
- `RoundTable.java` — an exercise that likely models circular seating or a rotation problem; probably uses `IntSList` or similar structures.
- `Test.java` — test/driver program; run this file if it contains `main` to exercise RoundTable functionality.
- `.ctxt` and `package.bluej` — BlueJ project files.

How to compile and run
----------------------
1. Compile all Java sources in the folder:

   javac *.java

2. Run the driver (replace `Test` with the actual public class that has `main` if different):

   java Test

What to look for
----------------
- If `RoundTable` simulates seating or rotations, test with various seat counts and rotation steps.
- Validate `IntSList` for edge cases: empty list, single element, repeated removals.

BlueJ notes
